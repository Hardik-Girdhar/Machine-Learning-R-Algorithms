# Machine-Learning-R-Algorithms
##ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies machine learning to predict customer spending scores based on demographic features like age, gender, and annual income. By analyzing these patterns, we aim to enhance customer segmentation, optimize marketing strategies, and support decision-making for targeted campaigns.

##ðŸŽ¯ Objective / Scope of Analysis
The objective is to leverage various machine learning models to classify customers into "Low," "Medium," or "High" spending categories. This analysis helps predict customer behavior, contributing to more personalized and effective engagement efforts.

##ðŸ“Š Data Used and Algorithms Applied
The dataset consists of fields such as Customer ID, Genre (gender), Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. The primary algorithms applied include:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies customers by finding the closest examples in the data. We used this method for its simplicity and efficiency in handling numerical data.

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier that assumes feature independence, ideal for quick classifications in moderate-sized datasets.

Decision Tree: A tree-like structure that makes decisions based on feature splits, allowing us to interpret patterns in customer behavior.

Logistic Regression: Applied as a binary classifier, identifying high-spending customers based on their likelihood of a positive outcome.

K-Means Clustering: Used to form unsupervised clusters, segmenting customers without labeled spending categories and giving insight into potential spending patterns.

##ðŸš€ Performance Comparison
Each algorithm was evaluated on key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and error rate. After fine-tuning, we assessed each model to understand which approach performs best for this dataset.
